Prefer to use views and stored procedures in spite of writing long queries. It’ll also help in minimizing network load
It’s better to introduce constraints instead of triggers. They are more efficient than triggers and can increase performance
Make use of table-level variables instead of temporary tables
The UNION ALL clause responds faster than UNION. It doesn’t look for duplicate rows whereas the UNION statement does that regardless of whether they exist or not.
Prevent the usage of DISTINCT and HAVING clauses.
Avoid excessive use of SQL cursors.

What are advantages of Indexes?

It allows faster retrieval of data
Indexes always speeds up the select statement.
Always create indexes on primary keys/foreign keys.
This is because primary keys and foreign keys are frequently used to join tables

What are disadvantages of Indexes?

Indexes slows down the performance of insert and update statements.So always we need follow best practice of disabling indexes before insert and update the table
Indexes takes additional disk space

What is mean by implicit index
Whenever we define unique key or primary key constraints on the table  the index will automatically create on the table.These indexes are known as implicit indexes

What are Explicit Indexes?
The indexes which is created by user are called as explicit indexes

What is composite index

When 2 or more columns are related to each other in the table and the same columns are used in where condition of the query then user can create index on both columns.These indexes are known as composite indexes.
